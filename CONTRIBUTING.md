# Contributing to Learn-Rust-Go-Java

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This guide will help you get started.

## 🎯 Our Mission

Create the most beginner-friendly programming tutorials that:
- Explain the "why" behind concepts, not just the "how"
- Build intuition through analogies and examples
- Cover details that other tutorials skip
- Help newcomers develop strong fundamentals

## 🤝 How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions Welcome

1. **Fix Typos and Errors**: Found a mistake? Please fix it!
2. **Improve Explanations**: Make concepts clearer
3. **Add Examples**: More practical examples are always helpful
4. **Create Exercises**: Add practice problems with solutions
5. **Translate**: Help make content accessible in other languages
6. **Add Lessons**: Expand the tutorial with new topics
7. **Improve Code**: Better examples or more idiomatic code

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues**: Someone might already be working on it
2. **Open an issue first**: Discuss major changes before implementing
3. **Keep it beginner-friendly**: Remember the target audience
4. **Follow the style**: Match the tone and structure of existing lessons

## 📝 Content Guidelines

### Writing Style

**Do**:
- ✅ Use simple, clear language
- ✅ Explain concepts with analogies
- ✅ Include "why" before "how"
- ✅ Provide multiple examples
- ✅ Anticipate beginner questions
- ✅ Use encouraging, positive tone

**Don't**:
- ❌ Assume prior knowledge
- ❌ Use jargon without explanation
- ❌ Skip "obvious" details
- ❌ Make learners feel dumb
- ❌ Just show code without explanation

### Example of Good Explanation

```markdown
## What is a Variable?

**Real-world analogy**: A variable is like a labeled box that holds a value.

**Why we need them**: Programs need to remember information. Variables give 
names to values so you can use them later.

**How to use them**:
```rust
let age = 25
```

**What's happening**: 
- `let` creates the box
- `age` is the label
- `25` is what goes inside
```

### Lesson Structure

Each lesson should follow this structure:

1. **Learning Objectives**: What will they learn?
2. **The Why**: Why does this concept exist?
3. **The What**: Clear definition
4. **The How**: Examples and code
5. **The Intuition**: Mental models and analogies
6. **Common Pitfalls**: What mistakes to avoid
7. **Practice Exercises**: Hands-on practice
8. **Key Takeaways**: Summary of important points

### Code Examples

**Every code example should**:
- Be complete (able to run as-is)
- Include comments explaining key parts
- Start simple, build complexity gradually
- Show common mistakes and corrections
- Follow language best practices

**Example**:
```rust
// Example 3: Variables and Scope
fn main() {
    let x = 5;  // x is created here
    
    {
        let y = 10;  // y is created in this inner scope
        println!("x: {}, y: {}", x, y);  // Both accessible
    }  // y goes out of scope here
    
    println!("x: {}", x);  // x still accessible
    // println!("y: {}", y);  // ERROR: y not in scope
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Guidelines

### File Organization

```
language/
├── README.md           # Language overview
├── lessons/
│   ├── 01-topic.md    # Numbered lessons
│   ├── 02-topic.md
│   └── ...
└── examples/
    ├── 01_example.ext # Working code examples
    ├── 02_example.ext
    └── ...
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Lesson files**: `##-descriptive-name.md` (e.g., `01-hello-world.md`)
- **Example files**: `##_descriptive_name.ext` (e.g., `01_hello_world.rs`)
- **Use lowercase and hyphens** for markdown files
- **Use lowercase and underscores** for code files

### Markdown Style

- Use headers properly: `#` for title, `##` for sections, `###` for subsections
- Include code fences with language specification: ```rust, ```go, ```java
- Use **bold** for emphasis, *italics* for terms
- Include emoji sparingly for visual markers (🎯, 💡, ⚠️)
- Break up text with examples, code, and lists
