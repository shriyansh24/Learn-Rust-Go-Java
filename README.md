# Learn Rust, Go, and Java: A Beginner's Journey

Welcome to your comprehensive guide to learning three powerful programming languages: **Rust**, **Go (Golang)**, and **Java**. This repository is designed specifically for absolute beginners, covering not just syntax, but the "why" behind every concept.

## 🎯 What Makes This Different?

Unlike typical tutorials that just show you code, this guide:
- **Builds Intuition**: Understand *why* things work the way they do
- **Theory + Practice**: Learn concepts and immediately apply them
- **Thought Process**: Follow the reasoning behind design decisions
- **Comprehensive Details**: Cover even the tiny basics that others skip
- **Real-World Context**: See how concepts apply in actual programming

## 📚 Course Structure

### [Rust Tutorial](./rust/README.md)
Start your journey with Rust, a systems programming language focused on safety and performance.
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Ownership and borrowing concepts
- Building reliable concurrent programs

### [Go Tutorial](./go/README.md)
Learn Go, a language designed for simplicity and efficient concurrent programming.
- Simple, clean syntax
- Built-in concurrency primitives
- Fast compilation
- Excellent for web services and tools

### [Java Tutorial](./java/README.md)
Master Java, one of the most popular languages for enterprise applications.
- Object-oriented programming principles
- Platform independence (Write Once, Run Anywhere)
- Extensive ecosystem and libraries
- Foundation for Android development

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

### Quick Start
👉 **[Get Started Now](./GETTING_STARTED.md)** - Installation and first steps for all three languages

### Learning Path
1. **Choose Your Path**: Pick a language that interests you or start with Go (easiest for beginners)
2. **Follow in Order**: Lessons build on each other - don't skip ahead
3. **Code Along**: Type every example yourself - don't copy-paste
4. **Experiment**: Modify examples to see what happens
5. **Take Notes**: Write down your understanding in your own words

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Basic computer literacy
- Ability to use a text editor
- Curiosity and willingness to learn
- No prior programming experience needed!

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

Each language directory contains setup instructions for:
- Installing the necessary tools
- Setting up your development environment
- Running your first program
- Debugging common issues

## 🤔 Which Language Should I Learn First?

**If you're completely new to programming**: Start with **Go**
- Simplest syntax
- Fast feedback loop
- Modern language design

**If you want to understand computer systems deeply**: Start with **Rust**
- Learn memory management
- Understand performance
- Build systems-level intuition

**If you want enterprise/Android development**: Start with **Java**
- Huge job market
- Extensive learning resources
- Well-established patterns

## 💡 Learning Tips

1. **Practice Daily**: Even 30 minutes consistently beats marathon sessions
2. **Debug Your Own Code**: Mistakes are the best teachers
3. **Read Error Messages**: They're trying to help you
4. **Build Projects**: Apply what you learn in small projects
5. **Teach Others**: Explaining concepts solidifies your understanding
